Collection of firmware and configs for smart home devices.

Contains only the customized firmware as well as the customized HomeMatic config for my sensor boards.

## HM-ES-RX-WM

Based on an [example](https://github.com/pa-pa/AskSinPP/tree/master/examples/HM-ES-TX-WM) for the Arduino [AskSinPP](https://github.com/pa-pa/AskSinPP) library.

The pins were changed for use with a custom board.
